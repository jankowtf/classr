## Implications of `ensureClassRegistration` for package namespace

- Date: 2014-09-20  
- Priority: 1
- Scheduled: NA
- Solved: NA
- Description:
  When calling `ensureClassRegistration` after loading the package, 
  it complains about closed namespaces (which makes sense). Check the 
  implications with respect to changing `where` for the planned use.
